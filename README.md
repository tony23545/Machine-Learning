# Machine-Learning
This repo contains documents of the Machine Learning course (graduate level) I took in Tsinghua University.  

### Some of the topics covered in this course:  
<ul>
  <li>Regression</li>
  <li>Multi Layers Perceptron</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
  <li>k-means Clustering</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>Bayesian Method</li>
  <li>Feature Selection</li>
  <li>Cross Validation</li>
  <li>principal component analysis</li>
</ul> 

### Final Project
Human early embryos analysis with RNA sequences. More information can be found on my <a href = https://github.com/tony23545/Machine-Learning/blob/master/final%20project/Machine%20Learning%20Final%20Project.pdf>report</a> and this <a href = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056876> paper</a> on Nature Method.  

One of my favorite plots from this project is the following one illustrating the clustering of RNA sequences of embroy cells from different days (different color represents different days). This is the result after PCA and t-sne.
